# Url_Shortner

## Introduction 
-------------
I notice that some links is extremely long for copying and pasting in the website. Sometimes, it is difficult to trace down those long links. However, with the help of UID, you can shorten the URL to just 5 characters through this project. 


## Installation 
-------------
The project is based on Django framework at the backend. The frontend is based on regular HTML and CSS. To build the project, you need to run the following commands.
```
python manage.py runserver 
```

To select a specific port (i.e. 8080), you can run 
```
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

## Developer's Note
--------------
Feel free to shorten the URLs to keep track of the links!
